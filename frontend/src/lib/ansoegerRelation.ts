// The "Ansøger relation" (relation_til_barnet) vocabulary.
//
// Kept here rather than inline in the two components that offer it, because
// they had already drifted apart from each other and from the OS2Forms mapping
// — which is what caused a form-created bevilling to show an empty relation the
// moment it was opened for editing.
//
// relation_til_barnet is a free-text column, not a lookup table, and the
// backend stores whatever os2forms_mapping.get_relation_til_barnet returns.
// That includes values this list cannot enumerate: for an applicant without
// custody the form returns `angiv_din_tilknytning_til_barnet` verbatim, i.e.
// whatever the applicant typed. A <select> over a free-text column can
// therefore never be complete, which is why callers should build their options
// with ansoegerRelationOptions() rather than using the list directly.

// Spelled to match backend/app/utils/os2forms_mapping.py, which returns
// "Forældremyndighed" — most bevillinger arrive through that flow, and it is
// the correct Danish noun. Rows created before this was aligned hold
// "Forældremyndig" and are carried by the fallback in ansoegerRelationOptions.
