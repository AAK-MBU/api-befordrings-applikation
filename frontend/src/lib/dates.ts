/**
 * The plausible date window for this application, snapped to year boundaries

 *
 * The range exists to catch typos — a mistyped year is the common failure, and
 * `isValidDate` alone accepts 1998 or 2071 happily because both are real
 * calendar dates.
 *
 * The forward half is +15 years, not +10, because +10 was narrower than a date
 * this application computes for itself. afstandskriterie_dato runs to the end
 * of the school year in which the student leaves their distance band, and the
 * worst case is a long way out:
 *
 *     skoleaarSlutter   today's year + 1 from August onwards
 *   + (10 - 0)          a børnehaveklasse pupil over 9 km, who qualifies all
 *                       the way to 10. klassetrin
 *   = today's year + 11, on 30 June
 *
 * At +10 the ceiling was 31 December of year + 10, so that pupil's own
 * correctly calculated 30 June of year + 11 was rejected as an implausible
 * year — on a field the caseworker cannot edit their way out of. +15 clears it
 * with room to spare and still catches a four-digit slip, which is the point.
 *
 * Use both halves together at every date input:
 *   - `MIN_DATE` / `MAX_DATE` as the `min`/`max` attributes, which bound the
 *     native picker and mark the field invalid;
 *   - `isDateOutOfRange` in the submit handler, which is what actually blocks
 *     the value — these forms submit via JS, so the attributes do not stop a
 *     pasted or typed value from being read through `bind:value`.
 *
 * Computed once at module load. A session spanning New Year keeps the window it
 * started with, which is immaterial at this width.
