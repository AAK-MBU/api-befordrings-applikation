/*
    Merge the nightly guardian load from Foraelder_STG into Foraelder.

    Same contract as usp_upsert_elev_from_stg: the data worker's job owns the
    stage and is the authority on the columns it carries, so a NULL arriving in
    STG overwrites. No load_id on the table, so the stage is processed whole
    and NOT cleared afterwards — it belongs to the other job.

    Matched on the composite key (cpr_foraelder, cpr_elev): a guardian appears
    once per child, so the same adult can legitimately have several rows.

    Not copied, and why:

      adresse_id              Always NULL in STG. Resolved separately from
                              LOIS.CPR.PersonGeoView — see
                              usp_upsert_adresse_ids_from_stg.

      maa_vide_barns_adresse  Deliberately left alone for now. The column is
                              present in the stage, so this is an exclusion
                              rather than an oversight — remove it from this
                              list when the import should own it.

    Guardians whose child is not in Elev are skipped rather than failing the
    batch. FK_Foraelder_Elev would reject them, and the two loads can
    legitimately arrive out of step; the count is returned so a persistent
    mismatch is visible instead of silent.
